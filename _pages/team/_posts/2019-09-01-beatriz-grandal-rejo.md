Gynecologist with a postgraduate degree in breast pathology, current PhD student at the RT2Lab, U932 team in Curie Institute. Enthusiastic about biostatistics, precision medicine and reconstructive surgery.

My research is based on neoadjuvant therapy. I am currently working on assessing the impact of BRCA status on pCR and immune infiltration. In parallel, I am pursuing different analyses on drug repurposing and the impact on response to treatment of concomitant drugs taken during anticancer treatment.
