I am currently a PhD student in the RT2Lab, Inserm U932 team. I am working with the SNDS database to study the geographic and socio-demographic disparities in oncology care pathways. Prior to this, I worked as a Data Scientist for several french startups on Natural Language Processing and Recommender Systems applications.
