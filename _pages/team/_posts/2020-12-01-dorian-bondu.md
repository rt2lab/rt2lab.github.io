I am currently a project manager in AI, & territory and health development program led by Pr Fabien Reyal. We are working on plenty of projects regarding the population-based responsibility and the local development of health care provision and organization. We benefit from the diversity of the team academic backgrounds, and the experts supporting us (surgeons, professors, researchers, etc.).
