I am a currently postdoctoral fellow at the RT2Lab, U932 team. I am working on several digital projects allowing to implement remote physical activity interventions through the use of mobile applications and physical activity trackers but also to follow cohorts of participants by collecting real life data from smartphones in order to establish new prevention strategies.

Passionate about sports and digital technology, I hope to contribute to the development of this field of research within the laboratory to improve cancer care.
