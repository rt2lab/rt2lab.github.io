I work as a postdoctoral researcher and data scientist at the RT2Lab, Institut Curie. My principal focus is the study of possible effects of comedications on response to chemotherapy treatment in breast cancer, with a particular focus on the analysis of large real life cohorts, where by definition randomization between treatment groups is not achieved.

I got my PhD in 2019 at Institut Curie, working on a novel method to infer large networks from observational data, with application to gene network reconstruction, protein structure and cancer cohorts.
